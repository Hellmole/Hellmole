My name is Jakub Jandura and I have extensive experience in the field of information technology and print system management. I specialize in front-end development and software process automation, with skills spanning a wide range of technologies from JavaScript to PHP and SQL databases. Currently, I am focusing on expanding my expertise in modern front-end frameworks.

In my coding work, I primarily work with plain JavaScript and PHP. Additionally, I work with SQL, HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap), XML, JSON, PowerShell, AHK, and PHP.

Currently, I am working on software automation of corporate processes (specifically automating orders, generating reports, notifications about goods in stock, transferring data from external systems to an internal SQL database, and vice versa). In my work, I use tools such as Postman, SSMS, DBeaver, Visual Studio Code, etc. I also use Altova MapForce server and Altova Flowforce server (for connecting and automating systems working with API and SQL, which I manage and further expand).

I have experience with data mining software, DMS, printing management software (MyQ), and long-term experience with servicing Kyocera printing devices, including related software and print management using PRESCRIBE.

From 2018 to the present, I have been working as a Technical Manager at Kyocera Document Solutions - managing and supporting internal systems, designing, and developing software solutions for customers (in the field of print management and data mining). I also lead a team of technicians and a software support and RMA department.

From 2007 to 2018, I worked as a technician â€“ primarily installing and servicing SW/HW printing solutions.

After school, from 2004 to 2007, I was involved in PHP and ActionScript programming (a scripting language for Adobe Flash). I also worked on producing internet banners and websites.

In 2004, I completed high school with a graduation exam (field of study: low-current electronic devices).
